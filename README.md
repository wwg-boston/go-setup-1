# Welcome to Women Who Go Boston
We're excited to start on this Go journey together, build some cool stuff, and get to know each other more through meeting and events. This repo will contain all the projects we'll be working on, along with documentation and other relevant information.

## Development Environment
You can feel free to choose any text editor, or IDE. Personally, I use Atom, the command line, and a web browser. I've found that it's all that you really need for what we're going to be doing. 

The packages that will be the most handy will be the `terminal-plus` package inside Atom which let's you have the terminal embedded into the application. To install you, you can go to `Atom > Preferences > Install` and search for the package there.

## Installing Go
We are going to install the binary version instead of building from source to kep things simple. Going to `https://golang.org/dl/` you will find the current binary for your system. I am using Go version 1.5.1, once you install, you can check to see what version you have with: 
`go version` 

And you should see something like:
`go version go1.5.1 darwin/amd64`

## Contact information
Feel free to email me (Alex) or Jen if you have any questions or suggestions for the meetups.
