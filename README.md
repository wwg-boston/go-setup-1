# First Meeting
Covers setting up your dev environment and creating several small programs

## Development Environment
You can feel free to choose any text editor, we'll be using Atom for the examples and run through.

The packages that will be the most handy will be the terminal-plus package inside Atom which let's you have the terminal embedded into the application. To install you, you can go to Atom > Preferences > Install and search for the package there.
